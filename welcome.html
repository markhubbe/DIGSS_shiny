<h1> Welcome to DIGSS </h1>
<p>This shiny version of DIGSS was created to facilitate the user interface.
    More details on DIGSS can be found in Pestle et al. XXXX (link here soon).</p>
    Help and walkthroughs are also available in the DIGSS vignette, accessible inside R or <a href="DIGSS.html" target="_blank" >here</a>.
<p>DIGSS can be run as a package directly in R. You can install it following:</p>
<code>devtools::install_github("markhubbe/DIGSS")</code>
<p>The package in R will give you more flexibility when running multiple simulations and further analyzing the results, however the interface is
    much more cumbersome </p>

<p>You can check out all the code behind DIGSS on github:</p>

<p>To run DIGSS, simply input the parameters for the simulation and press the Run DIGSS button.
    The Survey Loop allows you to run multiple sequential simulations. 
    <b>Soon DIGSS will be able to save results!</b> </p>


    <h2> Multiple Users or intense simulations</h2>
    <p><bold>A note for users interested in suing this vesrion of DIGSS with students or for those with extremelly large simulation goals:</bold></p>
    <p>shiny.apps have a limited ammount of memmory allocated to DIGSS, which means that multiple simultaneous users can cause the page to freeze.</p>
    <p> If you are planning on sharing this with multiple users 
    (e.g., in a classroom) or have very ambitious simulation goals, you can download the latest version of DIGSS_shiny as zip file <a href="DIGSS.html" target="_blank" >here</a> to load it in RStudio, 
    or run it from github:</p>
    <code>shiny::runGitHub('DIGSS_shiny', 'markhubbe')</code>
