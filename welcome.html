<h1> Welcome to DIGSS </h1>
<p>This shiny version of DIGSS was created to facilitate the user interface.
    More details on DIGSS can be found in Pestle et al. XXXX (link here soon).</p>
<p>DIGSS can be run as a package directly in R. You can install it following:</p>
<code>devtools::install_github("markhubbe/DIGSS")</code>
<p>The package in R will give you more flexibility when running multiple simulations, however the interface is
    much more cumbersome </p>

<p>To run DIGSS, simply input the parameters for the simulation and press the Run DIGSS button.
    The Survey loop will allow you to run multiple sequential simulations, at once. <b>Soon it will be able to save
        results.</b> </p>
