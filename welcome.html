<h1> Welcome to DIGSS </h1>
<p>This shiny version of DIGSS was created to facilitate the user interface.
    More details on DIGSS can be found in Pestle et al. XXXX (link here soon).</p>
    Help and walkthroughs are also available in the DIGSS vignette, accessible inside R or <a href="DIGSS.html" target="_blank" >here</a>.
<p>DIGSS can be run as a package directly in R. You can install it following:</p>
<code>devtools::install_github("markhubbe/DIGSS")</code>
<p>The package in R gives more flexibility when running multiple simulations and further analyzing the results, however the interface is
    much more cumbersome </p>

<p>You can check out all the code behind DIGSS on github:</p>
<p>For the R package: <a href="https://github.com/markhubbe/DIGSS" target="_blank"> github.com/markhubbe/DIGSS </a></p>
<p>For the Shiny version: <a href="https://github.com/markhubbe/DIGSS_shiny" target="_blank"> github.com/markhubbe/DIGSS_shiny </a></p></p>
<p>Comments, suggestions and bug reports are always welcome. Send them to <a href="mailto:hubbe.1@osu.edu">Mark Hubbe</a></p>

<p>To run DIGSS, simply input the parameters for the simulation and press the Run DIGSS button.
    The Survey Loop allows you to run multiple sequential simulations. </p>

<p><b>Soon DIGSS will be able to save results!</b> </p>

<h3> Warning for multiple users or intense simulations</h3>
    <p><bold>A note for users interested in using this version of DIGSS with multiple students simultaneously or for those with extremelly large simulation goals:</bold></p>
    <p>The shiny.apps server has a limited ammount of memmory allocated to DIGSS, which means that multiple simultaneous users will cause the page to freeze.</p>
    <p> If you are planning on sharing this with multiple users 
    (e.g., in a classroom) or have very ambitious simulation goals, you can download the latest version of DIGSS_shiny as a <a href="DIGSS.zip" target="_blank" >zip</a> file to load it in RStudio 
    (unzip folder, open app.R in RStudio, and run app from there), 
    or run it directly from github:</p>
    <code>shiny::runGitHub('DIGSS_shiny', 'markhubbe')</code>
